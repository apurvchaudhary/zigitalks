This is just a simple CAGR calculator i designed for cleartax
This page is used to calculate:
                              Common Annual Growth Rate for companies
                              Just give inputs such as: initial amount, final amount and no. years as a time period.
I am totally beginner to git ignore if i used more memory space than needed.
Thankyou
